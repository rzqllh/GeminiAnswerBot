## Troubleshooting

**API Key not working?**

- Ensure the key comes from AI Studio, not OAuth credentials.
- Use the "Test Connection" button to validate the key.
- Try regenerating a new key from a fresh project if needed.

**Quiz detection not working?**

- The page might use shadow DOM or iframes (partial support).
- Refresh the page after installing or enabling the extension.

## Privacy & Security

GeminiAnswerBot **does not collect any personal data**. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your Gemini API key is stored only in your local browser storage and never transmitted externally.

## Known Issues

- On some dynamic websites (e.g., using React or Shadow DOM), quiz extraction may be delayed.
- Google Gemini API may return slightly inconsistent results depending on model latency.

---

## Development Notes

- Use `content.js` to inject quiz logic and page scanning.
- `background.js` handles Gemini API communication.
- All UI logic for settings is handled in `options.js`.
- Prompts can be edited directly via `prompts.js`.

After any changes, go to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Reload** on GeminiAnswerBot.
