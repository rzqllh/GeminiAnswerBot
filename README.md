## 💡 Why GeminiAnswerBot?

Ever found yourself stuck on an online quiz, wishing you had a knowledgeable friend looking over your shoulder? That's exactly what this extension does — it reads the question, understands the context, and whispers the answer to you.

Unlike simple search tools that just highlight keywords, GeminiAnswerBot actually *comprehends* the question using advanced AI. It reads multiple choice options, understands what's being asked, and gives you a confident answer with reasoning you can learn from.
