## Privacy & Security

GeminiAnswerBot **does not collect any personal data**. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your Gemini API key is stored only in your local browser storage and never transmitted externally.

## Known Issues

- On some dynamic websites (e.g., using React or Shadow DOM), quiz extraction may be delayed.
- Google Gemini API may return slightly inconsistent results depending on model latency.


---

## Development Notes

- Use `content.js` to inject quiz logic and page scanning.
- `background.js` handles Gemini API communication.
- All UI logic for settings is handled in `options.js`.
- Prompts can be edited directly via `prompts.js`.

After any changes, go to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Reload** on GeminiAnswerBot.

## Changelog

### [1.3.0] - 2025-07-22
This version focuses on reliability, feature integration, and final polishing by removing external dependencies and centralizing the user experience.

Added
- Custom Notification System: Implemented a dependency-free, native-style notification system from scratch to provide reliable user feedback.
- Integrated History Panel: Merged the full functionality of the History page directly into the options dashboard under a new "History" tab for a unified experience.
- Data Management Tab: Added a new "Data" tab to the options sidebar, creating a dedicated space for actions like clearing history.
- Sidebar Icons: Added SVG icons to each sidebar item ("General", "Prompts", etc.) to improve visual navigation.

Changed
- Improved History Formatting: "Question Content" in the history panel is now automatically parsed and formatted into a clean, readable question-and-list format.

Fixed
- Critical JavaScript Error: Permanently resolved the persistent `Toastify is not defined` error by completely removing the external library dependency.
- Missing Prompt Content: Fixed a regression bug where prompt textarea elements appeared empty due to missing variable declarations in `options.js`.

Removed
- **Toastify.js Library**: Removed the external `toastify.js` and `toastify.css` library files in favor of the new custom notification system.
- **Standalone History Page**: Removed the `ui/history.html` and `js/history.js` files, as their functionality is now fully integrated into the options page.

### [1.2.0]
This release focused on a complete visual overhaul of the settings experience, migrating from a basic page to a modern, professional dashboard.

Added
- Dashboard UI: Completely redesigned the options page into a two-column dashboard with sidebar navigation ("General", "Prompts").
- macOS-inspired Styling: Implemented a new CSS theme from the ground up to align with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), featuring improved typography, spacing, and color palette.
- Transparent Blur Effect: Added a "frosted glass" effect to the sidebar using `backdrop-filter` for a native, modern feel.
- Separate Save Buttons: Implemented distinct "Save" buttons for the "General" and "Prompts" sections to improve user clarity.
- API Key Reveal Icon: Added an icon to the API key input field to show or hide the key.

Changed
- Button Consistency: Refactored all buttons to use a consistent base `.button` class with modifiers (`.button-primary`, `.button-secondary`, `.button-danger`) for a uniform look and feel.

### [1.1.0]
This update focused on refactoring the codebase for better maintainability and enhancing the core context menu features.

Added
- "Rephrase" Context Menu: Added a new "Rephrase this" action to the right-click context menu.
- Rephrase Language Setting: Added a setting in the options page to define target languages for the rephrase feature.

Changed
- Centralized Prompts (DRY): Refactored all default system prompts into a single source of truth, `js/prompts.js`, to eliminate code duplication.
- Improved History UI: Relocated the "Clear History" button to the header of the history page for better usability.

Fixed
- Corrected an invalid model name (`gemin-pro-latest`) in `options.html`.
- Fixed an invalid charset declaration in `history.html`.

Removed
- Removed the "Define this" action from the context menu to streamline options.

### [1.0.0]
Initial release of the GeminiAnswerBot extension.

Added
- Core quiz-solving functionality with automatic content extraction.
- On-page answer highlighting using Mark.js.
