3.  **Strict Formatting:** You MUST format the options as a Markdown list using hyphens (-). Each option MUST be on a new line.
4.  **Preserve Exact Original Text:** Do not modify spelling, symbols, spacing, punctuation, or case of the actual question and options. Wrap any code or technical terms in backticks (\`).
5.  **Direct Output:**
    - Return ONLY the cleaned, extracted content in Markdown.
    - NO prefaces, no commentary, no summaries.
    - NO formatting explanations.
    - NO translations.
6.  **CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE:**
